                <p>
                    My name is Jakob Loke, and I am currently a CrossFit coach as well as personal trainer that aspires to be a web developer!
                    I am passionate about helping people find their best self through fitness as well as finding confidence through it as well. 
                    Web development for me is an avenue to build something from the ground up that I can be proud of. If being a personal trainer is like an artist of the body then being a web developer you can be an artist for web pages!

                    This page will serve as a mode for me to display my web development work.
                    It will also serve as a place for potential employers as well as friends to connect with me!
